Privacy Policy for Domain Swapper
Last Updated: March 13, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Domain Swapper, a Chrome extension developed by Vicente Santos, handles your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency.

Information We Collect
Domain Swapper does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data to external servers. The extension uses the following permissions solely for its functionality:

activeTab: To access the current tab’s URL for domain swapping.
storage: To save your custom domain swaps (e.g., "from" and "to" domains, swap names, and enable/disable settings) locally in Chrome’s storage.
tabs: To update the tab’s URL during a swap.
All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome’s chrome.storage.sync API and is accessible only by the extension. No data is shared with third parties, and no analytics or tracking is performed.

How We Use Your Data
The data stored locally (domain swap configurations and toggle states) is used exclusively to enable the extension’s core feature: automatically redirecting between predefined domains. This data is never accessed, processed, or transmitted outside your browser.

Data Retention
All data is retained locally on your device for as long as you use the extension. You can clear this data by removing the extension from Chrome or resetting your settings manually. We do not have access to or control over this data.

Your Choices
You can disable the extension or individual swaps at any time via the popup interface.
To delete all stored data, uninstall the extension from Chrome (chrome://extensions/).

Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. The latest version will always be available here. Significant changes will be communicated via the Chrome Web Store listing or the extension’s popup.
